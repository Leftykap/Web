<h2> Launch </h2>
<p> The perserverance rover, also called the mars 2020 mission, launched on July 30th 2020 at 7:50 EST from Cape Canaveral. 
The rover was aboard the Atlas V rocket, launched from complex 41, where most Atlas V's launch from.
Atlas V has both solid and liquid rocket fuel, with the solid rocket boosters being dropped before entering orbit, and
the core liquid stage taking the rocket into orbit. There was also an interstage, with a second liquid rocket engine 
used to boost from earth orbit to Mars. To do this, the launch had to take place during a specific window of oppertunity. Because of 
Mars and Earth's orbits around the sun, only around once every 2 years, the planets line up in such a way that 
a rocket can get between them with minimal fuel use.

<h2> Mission </h2>
<p> 
Mars 2020's mission is mainly to "search for signs of ancient microbial life", however, it has equipment
on board to do a wide variety of data gathering and reaserch. It will use a drill to collect samples of Martian 
soil and rocks, and store them in extremely clean and lightweight tubes underneath the rover.
While the rover has some on board analysis, these tubes will also be deposited on the 
Martian surface to be collected by a later mission, or possibly when the first humans start
landing. The rovers design is based around Curiosity, the most recent rover to land on the planet.
However, it has had it wheels upgraded to avoid getting stuck, and has both more powerful and resistant
cameras and sensors, allowing it to get a full video and audio recording of its touchdown, as well as the martian surface.
Like Curiosity, it is nuclear powered by an RTG on its back, that can last much longer than solar panels, which would
get dirty due to the martian dust storms. There is also a MOXIE system on board, which can be used to generate
oxygen from the martian atmosphere. It works by condensing the atmosphere, then squeezing it through a electrolysis system,
which should seperate the carbon dioxide into oxygen and carbon monoxide. This would be used during any human landing for multiple uses, beyond just breathing.
Oxygen, while needed for human habitation, is also needed to create the oxidizer in the rocket fuel that any lander that would be returned to earth
needs. Another major component of the mission is Ingenuity. It will land with Perserverance, then detach on landing. It is a 
small drone-like rover, that uses 2 blades on top of it to fly through the extremely light martian atmosphere.
It will act to both be a proof of concept, and to help scout out perserverances area, to quickly find where it should go
to get the most data.

<h2> Landing </h2>
<p> Mars 2020's landing system is largely copied from Curiosity, using a skycrane.
Once the rover enters Mars's atmosphere at about 13,000 mph, drag will quickly heat up the heat shields. 
Using upgraded targeting systems, once it is lower in the atmosphere, it will deploy its parachute and then drop its heat shield.
  The 2 ton rover will then seperate from the 'shell' that its parachute is on, and freefall more then a full mile.
  Once it just tens of feet above the ground, skycrane will activate its 4 thrusters, rapidly slowing the 
  rover to a complete stop hopefully just feet above the ground. It will hover downwards, then release the rover onto the 
  surface without dropping it at all, which could damage the equipment. The crane will then
   cut its own lines connecting it to the rover, and engage its thrusters at full to get away from
    the rovers area of operation before crashing.</p>
